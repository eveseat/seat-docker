# Web server configuration.
# SeAT running in a docker-compose setup ships with Traefik
# as the default web server.
# In most cases, just configuring the domain and valid e-mail
# address will be all you need to do.
#
# For advanced users, if the default httpchallenge is not what
# you wanted, refer to the Traefik 2 docs here:
#   https://docs.traefik.io/https/acme/#the-different-acme-challenges

TRAEFIK_HTTP_PORT=80 # Only used for ACME, SeAT won't listen here.
TRAEFIK_HTTPS_PORT=443

# Web server TLS.
#
# One of the amazing features of Traefik is easy-mode TLS config
# together with Let's Encrypt. Simply Enable automatic certificate
# renewals by uncommenting the cert resolver lines in the seat-web
# service and enter your email address below (ACME requirement).
